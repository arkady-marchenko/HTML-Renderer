## HTML and CSS specification
* HTML 4.01
* CSS level 2

## Additional features
Jose took the liberty of adding a couple of features:
* Background gradients
* Rounded corners
**These are achieved thru the following CSS properties:**
* background-gradient: (color)
* background-gradient-angle: (number)
* corner-ne-radius: (length)
* corner-nw-radius: (length)
* corner-se-radius: (length)
* corner-se-radius: (length)
* corner-radius: (length){1,4} (shorthand for all corners)

**Note**
* When using rounded corners with borders, you must prevent the corner radius to be larger than the border thickness.
